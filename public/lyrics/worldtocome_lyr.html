<h3 id="1sam15_23">1 Samuel 15:23</h3>
<pre>
I became a crystal healer
And my ministry was to the sick
Creeping vines would send out runners
And seek me in their number

I sold
Self-help tapes
Go down to the netherworld
Plant grapes

And as word spread out of my powers
They would seek me far and wide
All sad faces at my window,
I would welcome them inside

I sold cloaks
Cloaks and capes
Go down to the netherworld
Plant grapes

My house will be for all people
Who have nowhere to go
My supply of shining crystals
Will shield against the snow

There's more like me where I come from,
So mark our shape
Go down to the netherworld
Plant grapes
</pre>
<h3 id="ps40_2">Psalms 40:2</h3>
<pre>
Pulled of the highway in Missouri
And lo, our hearts were heavy laden
Make for the chapel with some spray paint
For all the things we'd held in secret
Lord lift up these lifeless bones
Light cascading through the windows
All the rainbow's heavy tones
He has fixed his sign in the sky
He has raised me from the pit and set me high

Left that place in ruin
Drunk on the spirit
And high on fumes
Checked into a Red Roof and stayed up for several hours
And then slept like infants
In the burning fuselage of my gaze
Let my mouth be ever ever fresh with praise
He has fixed his sign in the sky
He has raised me from the pit and set me high

Each morning new
Each day shot through
With all the sharp small shards of shrapnel
That seem to burst out of me and you

Head down toward Kansas
We will get there when we get there
Don't you worry
Feel bad about the things we do all the way
But not really that bad
We inhaled the frozen air
Lord send me a mechanic if I'm not beyond repair
He has fixed his sign in the sky
He has raised me from the pit and he will set me high
</pre>
<h3 id="gen3_23">Genesis 3:23</h3>
<pre>
House up in Clearlake
Where I used to live
Picked the lock on the front door
And felt it give

Touched any move, nothing standing
Keep my ears open for for cars
See how other people here live now
Hope they are better at it than I was

I used to live here
I used to live here
I used to live here
I used to live here

Pictures up on the mantle
Nobody I know I
Stand by the tiny furnace
Where the long shadows grow

Living room to bedroom to kitchen
Familiar and warm
Hours we spent starving within these walls
Sounds of a distant storm

I used to live here
I used to live here
I used to live here
I used to live here

Fight through the ghosts in the hallway
Duck and weave
Stand by the door by my eyes closed
When it's time to leave

Steal home before sunset
Covered up my tracks
Drive home with old dreams that play in my mind
And the wind at my back

Break the lock on my own garden gate
When I get home after dark
Sit looking up at the stars
Like teeth in the mouth of a shark

I used to live here
I used to live here
I used to live here
I used to live here
</pre>
<h3 id="phil3_20_21">Philippians 3:20-21</h3>
<pre>
The path to the awful room
Where no one was sleeping again
Was lit for one man only
Gone where none can follow him

Try to look down
The way he'd gone
Like every closet
Whose depths go on and on

Nice people said he was with God
Safe in his arms
But the voices of the angels
That he heard on his last days with us
Slowly

Well the path to the palace of wisdom
That the mysics walk
Is lined with new electrics
And electric shock

Hope daily for healing
Try not to go insane
Dance in the circle with bells on
Try to make it rain

Nice people said he was with God
Safe in his arms, safe in his arms
But the voices of the angels
Singing to him in his last hours with us
Smoke alarms, smoke alarms
</pre>
<h3 id="heb11_40">Hebrews 11:40</h3>
<pre>
Masks hanging on the two walls with the coven graves
Witches hiding in the brambles
Ground level down where the dry leaves warp and burn slowly
No ground is ever gonna hold me

White candles the manor where the curse takes hold
Bodies reassembling down where the worms crawl
Make your own friends
When the world's gone cold

It gets dark and then
I feel certain I am going to rise again
If not by faith, then by the sword
I'm going to be restored

Building fires to keep the beacon flashing
Where the earth lies flat
Blood calls to blood as the hours draw down
Invent my own family, if it comes to that

Hold them close, hold them near
Nobody's ever gonna hurt them here

Steal the treasure and try to leave town
Fight my way back out
Don't want to hurt anyone
Probably gonna have to before it's all done

Take to the hills, run away
I'm gonna get my perfect body back someday
If not by faith, then by the sword
I'm going to be restored
</pre>
<h3 id="gen30_3">Genesis 30:3</h3>
<pre>
For several days the vistors were here
We saw them turn down and watched them disappear
Talked about the days we said that shouldn't come
Had a hard time believing

I remember seeing you my tongue struck dumb
When you first came here from wherever it is was you came from
The power in your voice, your rough touch
You keep good care of me, keeping watch

Open up the doors to the tent
Wonder where the good times went

I will do what you ask me to do
Because of how I feel about you

I saw his little face contract as his eyes went light
Try to imagine anything so bright
You only see it once, then steals into the dawn
Then it's gone forever

For several hours we lay there, last ones of our kind
Harder days coming, maybe, I don't mind
Sounds kind of dumb, but I say it 'cause it's true
I would do anything for you

Open upthe promise of the day
Drive the dark things away

I will do what you ask me to do
Because of how I feel about you
</pre>
<h3 id="rom10_9">Romans 10:9</h3>
<pre>
Wake up sixty minutes after my head hits the pillow I can't live like this
And in the shower I am a sailor standing, waiting ready on the shipless
Everything looks burned up I'm too scared too look around
Don't feel like going on, but come on, make a joyful sound

If you will believe in your heart and confess with your lips
Surely you will be saved one day

Try to think of ways to fix myself but everything winds up inside a cul-de-sac
The beast broke from the barn while we were sleeping face-to-face it is not coming back
Don't see what the point is in even trying to fight
Look for the bigger picture when I close my eyes real tight

If you will believe in your heart and confess with your lips
Surely you will be saved one day

Look for the sign of Daniel
Consider the clues
Wait as long as I have to for good news

Wake and rise and face the day and try to keep the day from staring back at me
Busy hours and joyful hearts and maybe later head out to the pharmacy
Won't take the medication but it's nice to have around
A kind and loving god won't let my small ship run aground

If you will believe in your heart and confess with your lips
Surely you will be saved one day
</pre>
<h3 id="1john4_16">1 John 4:16</h3>
<pre>
In the holding tank I built for myself
It's feeding time
And I start to feel afraid 
'Cause I'm the last one left in line

The endless stretch of summer stars had led me to this day
Began one afternoon with you long ago and far away

And someone leads the beast in on his chain
But I know you're thinking of me
'Cause it's just about to rain
So I won't be afraid of anything ever again

In the cell that holds my body back, the door swings wide
And I feel like someone's lost child as the guards lead me outside

If the clouds are gathered here it's just to point the way
To an afternoon I spent with you when it rained all day

And someone leads the beast in on his chain
But I know you're thinking of me
'Cause it's just about to rain
So I won't be afraid of anything ever again
</pre>
<h3 id="mat25_21">Matthew 25:21</h3>
<pre>
They'd hooked you up to a fentanyl drip
To mitigate the pain a little bit
I flew in from Pennsylvania
When I heard the hour was coming fast

And I docked in Santa Barbara
Tried to brace myself
But you can't brace yourself when the time comes
You just have to roll with the blast

And I'm an eighteen wheeler headed down the interstate
And my brakes are gonna give and I won't know 'til it's too late
Tires squealing when I lose control
Try not to hurt to many people when I roll

Find the Harbor freeway and head south
Real tired, head kind of light
I found Telegraph road
I'd only seen the name on envelopes

Found the parking lot and turned right
I felt all the details carving out space in my head:
Tropicanas on the walkway, neon red
Between the pain and the pills trying to hold it at bay
Stands a traveler going somewhere far away

And I am an airplane tumbling wing over wing
Try to listen to my instruments they don't say anything
People screaming when the engines quit
I hope we're all in crash position when we hit

And then came to your bedside
As it turns up, I'm not ready
And as though you were speaking through a thick haze
You said hello to me

We all stood there around
Happy to hear you speak
The last of something bright burning, still burning
Beyond the cancer and the chemotherapy

And you were a presence full of light upon this earth
And I am a witness to your life and to its worth
It's three days when I get the call
And there's nobody around to break my fall
</pre>
<h3 id="deut2_10">Deuteronomy 2:10</h3>
<pre>
The sun above me and the concrete floor below
Scratch at the chain link, maybe bare my teeth for show
Fed twice a day, I don't go hungry anymore
Feel in my bones just what the future has in store

I pace in circles so that everyone can see:
Look hard at my stripes,
There'll be no more after me.

Lay by the shoreline while the sailors disembark
Scratch out of place to sit and rest down in the dark
Smell something burning downwind just a little way
They set up camp and sweat and work for days

I have no fear for anyone, I'm dumb and wild and free:
I am a flightless bird
And there'll be no more after me.

In Costa Rica in a burrow underground
Climbed to the surface, lick my eyes, look around
I'm all alone here as I dried my tiny soul
Cleared my place below the sky, I don't be here for more

I sang all night, the moon shone only through the trees
No brothers left,
And there'll be no more after me.
</pre>
<h3 id="is45_23">Isaiah 45:23</h3>
<pre>
If my prayer be not humble, make it so
In these last hours if the spirit waits in check, help me let it go
And should my suffering double let me never love you less
Let every knee be bent and every tongue confess

And I won't get better
But someday I'll be free
'Cause I am not this body
That imprisons me

I read the magazines somebody brought
Hold them to my failing eyes until my hands get hot
And when the nurse comes in to change my sheets and clothes
The pain begins to travel, dancing as it goes

And I won't get better
But someday I'll be free
'Cause I am not this body
That imprisons me

If my prayer goes unanswered, that's alright
If my path fills with darkness and there is no sign of light
Let me praise you for the good times, let me hold your banner high
Until the hills are flattened and rivers all run dry

And I won't get better
But someday I'll be free
'Cause I am not this body
That imprisons me
</pre>
<h3 id="ez7">Ezekiel 7 and the Permanent Efficacy of Grace</h3>
<pre>
The clouds explode and then the desert blooms
Someone will need to mop this floor for me
When I emerge I find my car
Like a cathedral in a dream of the future

Drive 'til the rain stops
Keep driving

Pull over and blast off when I get the chance
Clear as an insect's wings in sunlight
Flip on the high stakes radio
Try to sing the words right

Drive 'til the rain stops
Keep driving

I had his arms tied up behind him
We were together all day
Maybe make Culiacan by sunset
Try to anyway

High as the clouds now
Flying

Drive 'til the rain stops
Keep driving
</pre>
<h3 id="pr6_27">Proverbs 6:27</h3>
<pre>
Try to hide down in the darkness
Get accustomed to our shapes
Rained in until next week at the earliest
Go through a box of betamax tapes

Pull the blankets up to my neck
And the screen began to glow
I cried real tears when they beat Chuck Norris down
Wait here in the shadow 'til the shadows let me go

And to you, crushing moment like a gift
And wait for the fog to lift

Pretend I'm waiting for a notice
From someone somewhere far away
Sit here and break things while I'm waiting
As day gives way to day gives way to day gives way to day

But though I try to let the shadows mask my movements
They're never gonna hide me like they used to
I watched the Delta Force save everybody from that plane on fire
I was watching, wishing I had not lost track of you

I treat each crushing moment like a gift
And wait for the fog to lift
