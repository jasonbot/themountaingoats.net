<h3><a name="recognition"> 
the recognition scene</a></h3> 

E, F#, A, E (x2)

E                      F#
we broke the doorknob off of the door. 
A                   E       
the door swung open easily. 
E                      F#
we sauntered into the poorly lit store, 
A                 E
and looked around lazily. 
E                                 F#
we stole every bit of candy they had inside. 
A                               E
gobbled it all up greedily on our 3 month ride.
E                              F#
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone. 
          A                    E
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone. 

you headed out to the getaway car 
and hit the open road 
I saw something written in tall clear letters on your face 
but I could not break the code. 
we had hot caramel sticking to our teeth 
and the only love I've ever known buring underneath 
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone. 
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone. 

I'm gonna miss you when you're gone. 
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone. 




<h3><a name="seoul"> 
downtown seoul</a></h3> 

there was a new song on the air. 
I saw you coming across the square. 
and a white bird broke the dark korean sky 
as the rest of my life went by 

I had your warm hand on my face. 
I took your index finger in between my teeth, 
and I held it gently in place. 
it was resting lightly on my tongue in there. 
I saw you shaking in the cold korean air. 
[and] there but for the grace of the lord of song 
I would be this very second and I'm coming right along. 
you had your cardigan on. 
I looked toward the sky and the white bird was gone. 
I remember your eyelids. 
I remember your body now. 




<h3><a name="trees"> 
some swedish trees</a></h3> 

1,2 1,2,3,4 
john: oh you don't want to start like that? you want me to do the thing. 
rachel: that's not how we ever start it. 

well you were standing in the door 
while I wondered what you were waiting for 
I saw the wild strawberries on the vine 
out of control 

well I was trying to think of something clever 
you were saying nothing whatsoever 
I saw the berries throw their hooks into the soil 
felt the blood between us churning thick as motor oil 

we'd come from california 
the air around you was familiar to me now 
if you were gazing westward 
I was looking at you again 
yeah. 




<h3><a name="wonder"> 
I wonder where our love has gone</a></h3> 

spoken: I who have sat by thebes below the wall and walked 
among the lowest of the dead 

all I know is I'm in love with you 
even though you say that we are through 
I know without your love I just can't go on 
I wonder where our love has gone. 

always thought you'd love me more and more. 
never dreamed you'd ever let me go. 
I know without your love I just can't go on. 
I wonder where our love has gone. 

now what did I do 
and what did I say 
that ever could lead you to treat me this way? 
if I've been untrue, I'm willing to pay. 
and darling if that's not enough I'll do anything you say. 
so darling please wherever you may be, 
hear my plea. 
and hurry home to me. 
I know without your love I just can't go on. 
I wonder where our love has gone. 




<h3><a name="crush"> 
deianara crush</a></h3> 

one day in september you come here. 
you pull my head down 
and you whisper in my ear. 
and you tell me the sidewalk is as far as the world really goes 
but that's a secret everybody knows. 

you hold my head in your hands. 
you say my name. 
how is it that though you say it some twenty thousand times it's never quite the same 
and you tell me that hercules died burning consumed by an article of his own clothing 
that's something I'd rather not be reminded of. 




<h3><a name="world"> 
whole wide world</a></h3> 

the last of the repercussions died off real slow 
and the sky was still 
and the cold sun sank down beneath the snow 
I hung by my hand from the tree outside 
and I looked at the whole wide world. 

when the voices came quietly. 
I shut them down. 
when a tricky young southerly wind 
came at me with its high whistling sound. 
I turned around to face it 
with real arrogance burning inside. 
and I drank in the whole wide world. 




<h3><a name="flashing"> 
flashing lights </a></h3> 

I am wearing a white long sleeved button-down. 
the pink colors behind the clouds tonight 
mirror the softer shades of your nightgown 
as the neuro-transmitters go crazy inside of me 
you swear you're leaving town 
empty promises empty promises. 

I am watching the way the wind seems to pass straight through your body. 
when you run your fingernail along my neck, you spill some water on me. 

you say you're as good as gone 
well, don't look now but here comes the dawn 
empty promises empty promises. 
empty promises empty promises. 




<h3><a name="xxx"> 
sept 19 triple x love! love!</a></h3> 

...i bet you don't know... 

I cut down that withered peach tree 
just like you asked me to. 
and I hacked it into pieces 
set it on fire with your face in plain view 
at the near window where you stood 
watching me split the wood 
I will do as I am told. 
I will keep away the cold. 

the fire pit in the snow 
gave off a rich bright orange-red glow 
a familar scent rose up into the air 
and I remembered something special from a long time ago 
you opened up the door 
stepped away from the killing floor 
your footprint on the snow was fresh and new 
when you touched me I felt fire coming through 
I will do as I am told. 
I will keep away the cold. 
I will do as I am told. 
I will keep away the cold. 




<h3><a name="queens"> 
going to queens</a></h3> 

the ghostly sing-song 
of the children playing double-dutch. 
I felt the wind come through the window 
I felt it turn around and switch back. 
in the second story room 
in jamaica queens 
your hair was dripping wet. 
your skin was clean. 
and the children skipping rope 
tripled their speed 
you were all I'd ever wanted 
you were all I'd ever need. 
in new york city 
in the middle of july 
the air was heavy and wet 
the air was heavy, your body was heavy on mine. 
I will know who you are yet. 
I will know who you are yet. 




<h3><a name="maker"> 
tahitian ambrosia maker</a></h3> 

we were real hungry and half dead 
when you broke out half a loaf of sourdough bread. 
and in the tropical air the scent rose like a spirit. 
moments of grace like this being wholly unmerited. ahh. 

we were newly alive and I felt your hand on my arm. 
I was awake to the sensation and immune from all harm. 
you pressed your soft cheek up against my gut. 
pure gold. nothing but gold,
and I'm gonna bake you a nice coconut cream pie. 
'cause I saw the sky coming down to meet you. 




<h3><a name="bolivia"> 
going to bolivia</a></h3> 

john: it is the only appliance that grinds the grain into flour 
and kneads the dough in the same container 

I cut myself a two-foot switch from some tropical hardwood nearby. 
and the sounds of a carnival drifted miraculously 
through the air from a thousand miles away. 
the monkeys jumped from tree to tree. 
it sent a deathly chill through me 
in bolivia 

wildcats I had never seen claimed places in my room. 
animal noises rang through the thick brush like voices from the tomb. 
I saw the freshly polished chrome 
gleaming in the mid-day sun. 
and I knew that you were coming home 
to bolivia. 

hey hey 




<h3><a name="tollund"> 
tollund man</a></h3> 

I was sitting at the edge of the marsh 
when the council came to bring me the news. 
they handed me a bowl of cooked wild grasses and they 
gave me the ceremonial shoes. 

goodbye young danish women. 
goodbye danish sky. 
goodbye cold air I am going away. 
goodbye goodbye goodbye. 




<h3><a name="california"> 
california song</a></h3> 

I know you see mars in the sky tonight 
I know you can see venus rising and veering off to the right. 
but can you see that young star overhead? 
it's the one that designed my undoing. 
I know that in california the waves break on the beach. 
and I know that the foam on the breaking waves 
is as white as household bleach. 
but do you see that particular white right now 
it's the color of the young star coming on down. 
I got joy joy joy in my soul tonight 
I got joy joy joy in my arms alright. 
although you treat me badly,
I love you madly. 
you really got a hold on me. 
you really got a hold on me. 




<h3><a name="snow"> 
snow crush killing song</a></h3> 

when I ask you to look at me 
you look away. 
I ask you to tell me something nice once. 
you come at me with all your hot lights on display. 
I know you're changing. 
damn you. 
I know you're changing. 
god damn you for that. 

when the snow stacked up outside,
you looked around. 
I could see you from the window. 
I could see the snow coming down. 
I know you're changing. 
damn you. 
I know you're changing. 
god damn you.

<h3><a name="neon"> 
neon orange glimmer song</a></h3> 

there's a capsicum pepper plant growing out in the backyard 
there's a capsicum pepper plant growing out in the backyard 
and I... I am a monster 
I can't believe the thing I've done. 
I can't believe the thing I've done. 

there's a friend of mine living in dallas 
about a two days' drive from here. 
gotta friend of mine living in dallas 
and that's a two days' drive from here. 
and I... I am a monster 
I can't believe the thing I've done. 
I can't believe the thing I've done. 

and there's a cold wind blowing. 
and there's a silver bell hanging. 
and there's a silver bell ringing. 
and I... I am a monster 
I can't believe the thing I've done. 
I can't believe the thing I've done. 




<h3><a name="fm"> 
fm</a></h3> 

hurry the bottle mama. 
it's grapefruit wine. 
kick off your high-heeled sneakers 
it's party time. 
the girls don't seem to care what's on. 
as long as it plays 'till dawn. 
no static at all. 

give her some fucked-up music 
she treats you nice. 
feed her some hungry reggae 
she'll love you twice. 
the girls don't seem to care tonight 
as long as the mood is right. 
no static at all. 
no static at all. 
hey.




<h3><a name="prana"> 
prana ferox</a></h3> 

spoken: you wake up in the morning feeling gloriously alive 
with the firm conviction that the problems that disturbed you in the past 
will now disappear disappear disappear 
into the midnight of your consciousness. 

I went down to the basement 
to check up on the sour mash 
I looked down to the nonreactive ceramic tub 
it was bubbling. 
I had stirred up the dust on the stairs coming down. 
I saw the dust devils swarming around. 
incoming sun beams cut them apart. 
and I watched a shadow pass across my heart. 
you were upstairs in the kitchen with your head against the sink. 
trying to cool down. 
trying to cool down. 

I know you don't believe me but I could hear you breathing 
I looked into the tub and there the mixture was seething 
with new life. 
new life all around. 
I had stirred up the dust on the stairs coming down. 
you were upstairs in the kitchen with your head against the sink. 
trying to cool down. 
trying to cool down. 
yeah. 




<h3><a name="cold"> 
cold milk bottle</a></h3> 

rainbows shone on the glass. 
dew drops gathered on the grass. 
and the yellow sun came into view. 
another god-damned message from you 
well despite your best efforts I feel alright 
against my better judgement I feel alright. 
despite your random acts of violence I feel alright 
despite the force of your fury I feel alright. 

you're mean to me. 
why must you be mean to me? 
you shouldn't forget you see 
what you mean to me.
