<h3><a name="lettinggo">
then the letting go</a></h3>

down in the south bronx
down home
saw you walking down the street again 
saw you looking sweet again

i saw you coming through
i turned my head away from you
why do you come here
why do you come around 
why'd you go home
why'd you head on home to rockaway? (rock away)?



<h3><a name="heights">
heights</a></h3>

when the seashells crumbled in your hand
you looked up up at me
and the sand shifting underneath your feet
softened for you and incredibly the sun went through from the sky
and i was certain i was going to cry

but then you reached up and you reached out
we'd been staring at the water all day
and then you touched me you were golden
you were giving the game away

when the sand crabs ran across your face
you didn't even twitch
and a soft scent came across the water
impossibly rich
impossibly cold
we were just nineteen years old

but then you reached up and you reached out
we'd been staring at the water all day
and then you touched me you were golden
you were giving the game away



<h3><a name="catalina">
alpha double negative: going to catalina</a></h3>

i hear you starting up again
i seee you standing on the deck
i hear your voice start to carry
i see the veins throbbing in you neck

and i know what you're saying
and i know what you're saying it for
but i'm not listening
i'm not listening anymore

and i see you come toward me
i see the sun withdrew from the sky
i hear your voice getting stronger and louder
and i see a stranger in your eyes

and i know what you're saying
and i know what you're saying it for
but i'm not listening
i'm not listening anymore



<h3><a name="hellhound">
hellhound on my trail</a></h3>


gotta keep moving
gotta keep moving
blues falling down like hail
gotta keep moving
blues falling down like hail

and the daylight keeps moving
there's a hellhound on my trail

if today was christmas eve
and tommorow were christmas day
if today was christmas eve
and tommorow were christmas day

all i would need is my little rider
and the world would fade away

gotta keep moving
gotta keep moving
blues falling down like hail
gotta keep moving
blues falling down like hail

and the daylight keeps ta worryin' me 
there's a hellhound on my trail



<h3><a name="blueberry">
blueberry frost</a></h3>

when you saw the evening star 
shining in the freezing sky
i saw somthing dark and silent passing by

full moon
deep grass
cold water

when you said your name out loud
something broke inside me
nothing new to take ahold of
no new world to hide me

full moon
deep grass
cold water

full moon
deep grass
cold water



<h3><a name="alabama">

B          Amaj9 E
your house is depressing
B          Amaj9 E
your house is dirty
B          Amaj9      E
why don't you come outside a little while
B          Amaj9       E
why don't you step out into the sun
       B    A   E
let me take you down
       B    A   E
let me ease you around montgomery

and out there on the front porch
your hair shines in the sun
and i can see the sun gathering on your eyes
what the hell are you looking at

let me take you down
let me ease you around montgomery



<h3><a name="moon">
moon and sand     </a></h3>

deep is the midnight sea
warm is the fragrant night
sweet are you lips to me
soft as the moon and sand

oh when shall we meet agin
when the night has left us 
will the spell remain

the waves invade the shore
though we may kiss no more
night is at our command
moon and sand

the waves invade the shore
though we may kiss no more
night is at our command
moon and sand



<h3><a name="ears">
i will grab you by the ears</a></h3>

the wind blew in across the water
and the wind blew through you hair
and i walked around the lake's perimeter
and then i saw you there

i will grab you by the ears 
i will grab you by the ears 
i will grab you by the ears 
and you will know something
you will know something

i saw the birds fly out across the lake
i saw the birds go by
and i walked around the lake's perimeter
and i saw the lake reflected in your eyes

i will grab you by the ears 
i will grab you by the ears 
i will grab you by the ears 
and you will know something
you will know something



<h3><a name="froze">
it froze me</a></h3>

i saw you in the blazing light
when the lotus caught fire
in the middle of the night
it froze me
it froze me

i saw you coming closer real slow
you grabbed hold
i let go
yeah i saw you in the blazing light
i saw you 
i saw you alright
it froze me
it froze me
it froze me
it froze me



<h3><a name="flower">
full flower</a></h3>
i saw the ceiling spin.
and i saw the room shift.
and i watched the television flicker.
and i let my mind drift.
i would give anything in the world up for you,
but i will not stop.

i saw the blossom form.
and i saw the screen glow.
and i let my arm fall to my side.
and i took one step back.
i would give anything in the world up for you,
but i will not stop.



<h3><a name="million">
million</a></h3>
when i came back from finland
the taxi took me down the street 
i saw the red flowers growing like they used to by the roadside
in the smothering summer heat

you were standing out in front of the house
with your floral print dress on
and you had questions only a masochist would ask 
writen all over your big brown eyes
the moon is high over iowa at night 
the moon is high over iowa at night 
and i brought your a blanket
hand woven, hand dyed
the moon is high over iowa at night



<h3><a name="bogata">
going to bogat&#225;</a></h3>
i know what i want
and i know what we need
when the first fruits of the harvest 
begin to blacken and bleed 
and the purple fruit gives way when you press it 
even so slightly
and through the thatches behind the green leaves
we heard the fire-eyed mccaw sing as evil as you please
his little song
is a very pretty song
but its something i won't stand for

and as the sun rises over columbia
i know we're done for

when the holes started forming in the tent
and you wondered out loud where the sunlight went
i had a mind to tell you
but i didn't want to hurt you
and if i knew how to form the words
i would ask you what you'd come for

but as the sun rises over columbia
i know we're done for

yeah as the sun rises over columbia
i know we're done for
as the sun rises over columbia
i know we're done for



<h3><a name="pain">
orange ball of pain</a></h3>
when i saw it on the bakery carousel 
i knew i had to have it for my own
i eased it out
and i brought it home

why don't you try some
i already had some myself
is that the most delicious thing 
you ever tasted in your life
is that the most delicious thing 
you ever tasted in your life

and then the cold sorrow gripped me by the throat
and then i felt the colder sadness taking hold
i knew i had to have it for my own

why don't you try some
why don't you try some
is that the most delicious thing 
you ever tasted in your life
is that the most delicious thing 
you ever tasted in your life

and then i saw the snow against the window
and then i saw the snow hit the window
and then i saw the snow brush against the window
and then i saw the snow in here



<h3><a name="kansas">
going to kansas</a></h3>
you were all dressed in green
clouds bounced against the edges of the sky
you had the prettiest hair i'd ever seen
we watched the world passing by

there was an ocean's droning
though we were nowhere near the shore
we heard each other giggling and moaning
then we couldn't hear each other anymore

when my head was resting on your breastbone
i could hear your beating heart
and twenty-four hours later
you had left me completely alone
i watched the whole world come apart

and you were all dressed in green
rising in thet sky was an unfamiliar star 
and you know what i mean
i rememeber who you are



<h3><a name="waving">
waving at you</a></h3>
listen you can tell your lawyer
that he can go to hell
'cause i can take whatever you're offering up reasonably well
and if four long years come to nothing that's alright
'cause it's your birthday
it's your birthday tonight

and i went to buy something
but i caught myself in time
and nothing makes any sense anymore
but everything rhymes

die hard 
die kicking 
old habit of mine
die hard 
die kicking 
old habit of mine
die hard 
die hard
die kicking 



<h3><a name="reykjavik">
going to reykjavik</a></h3>
i been drinking that coffee you sent me from thailand
i've been watching the lamps burn
i've been listening to the wind chime
i've been waiting my turn

and i'm coming to you
i am coming to you
i am coming to you

and i heated the milk until it boiled
and i drank it down
and i stepped outside 
and i checked my reflection in the rain
there were voices on the wind
winter coming on in
and i made myself up again, brand new

and i am broken and i am tired
and i'm coming to you with my mouth
dripping



<h3><a name="corinthians">
i corinthians 13: 8-10</a></h3>
we heard the rats in the rafters scurry by
and we wondered about the color of the sky outside
in warsaw in 1939
it was alright just to be alive
it was good that you were mine
and you held your hands up
to form a heart in the air
you held you hands up with your thumbs touching
they formed a heart in the air

through the piece missing in the brick wall
we had an excellent view of the soldiers coming down the wall
and you held your hands up where i could see them 
in the dark and they formed a heart in the air
you held you hands up
and they formed a heart in the air

i heard the old songs radiating from you
i heard the old songs radiating from you


<h3><a name="scotland">
going to scotland</a></h3>
there was a barn owl trapped in the rafters
the ground underneath us was wet and cold
we heard the owl thrashing about
trying desparately to get out
we stood outside and watched the night unfold

we watched the sun go down on scotland
and i watched the moon come up over you
when a pack of dogs went silently past us
we knew we'd been given fair warning
but that was the only thing we knew

and you threw all your luggage out onto the water
and i tore the shirt away from my back
the cold came on with a new found intensity 
and you pressed your warm body against me
and i loved you so much it was making me sick

and we watched the sun go down on scotland
we were glad that we'd left oklahoma behind
i took your hips in my hands and i threw you down
to the new found rich brown deep wet ground
had a vision of you burning on my mind

we watched the sun go down on scotland
and i watched the moon come up over you
when a pack of dogs went silently past us
we knew we'd been given fair warning
but that was the only thing we knew
