<h3> <a name="birthday"> birthday song: this time has gone</a> </h3>
the sun came out this morning I was wide awake
and I made way down to the kitchen and i cut myself a piece of my birthday cake.
raspberry filling in the middle.
and i thought about you a little.
and there was a time when you wanted me so bad it was eating you up inside.
but this time has gone away.

i poured myself a tall glass of milk it was deep and cold.
and i checked my driver's license i was 28 years old.
and there was a time when you wanted me so bad it was eating you up inside.
this time has gone away.



<h3> <a name="palestine"> </a> going to palestine</h3>
that woman set herself on fire
they said it on the radio
they said she lit off the skies of palestine
i could not stand to hear them say so
i saw the stars come out
i saw the oranges on the trees
later on they played some carribean song
man they sure know how to pick 'em
the rich voice burning like a fuse
the syncopated rhythms
i saw the stars come out
i saw the oranges cracking open
i saw you standing there
orange blossom in your hair
going to palestine
going to palestine



<h3> <a name="tulsa">tulsa imperative</a></h3> 
<h6> performed by Diskothi-Q on <u>the Wandering Jew</u></h6>
your momma's failed wheat field 
is a good place to lie down together. 
three weeks deep into the guts of summer, 
we sweat like hogs, and i felt light as a feather.

i saw a disk-like object
reflected in your eye. 
and the noise grew louder 
as we looked up to the sky.
 
and the sleek silver body, 
headlights along the side. 
and the sleek silver body, 
headlights all underneath.
 
i remember the warm air, 
blowing in our faces. 
i remember the heat 
running through me.
 
there was no one worth telling. 
there was nothing we could do. 
and i was real quiet as i took the keys from the kitchen table. 
i was looking right at you!
 
and your hand brushed against mine 
yeah, and it shook me inside. 
all along the night sky 
i watched our futures collide.
 
and the car's new headlights 
cut through the darkness. 
as the oil dripped silently 
to the pavement underneath.
 
i can remember the warm air 
burning our faces. 
i remember the heat 
running through me.

<h3><i>jonathan maier is a great guy for sending me this</i></h3>

<h3> <a name="calcutta">calcutta</a> </h3> 
Wild donkeys kicking, braying in the meadow
made you want to kick and bray yourself at least you said so
you were wild eyed, your lips were flecked with foam
till warm calcutta called you home
twin rivers flowing brought a flush into your cheeks
at the spot where the trickling stream's rivers meet
the wind from off the snowcapped mountains cooled you down
till warm calcutta brought you back around
i could hear the prophets yelling in the streets
now your eyes were pure poison, but your skin was sweet

<h4> thanks to <i>dylan evans</i> for the song prior to this line</h4>


<h3> <a name="cutter">cutter</a> </h3> 
i'd had you out of my mind for a year or better
when the mailman handed me your letter
and i recognize the handwriting even now
but i know i'm gonna open it anyhow
and noone's been buying from my roadside stand, and i 
held your letter like a cross to my chest
i'm gonna wrap up my troubles
i'm gonna wrap up my troubles
i'm gonna wrap up my troubles
in you.

i walked out into the kitchen
where the light came through the 4-paneled window
clean and bright and it's taken me two years to realize
how much i like the way that you dot your I's
well, i was born in indiana thirty years ago
and i got a mean, mean hunger down below
i'm gonna wrap up my troubles
i'm gonna wrap up my troubles
i'm gonna wrap up all my troubles
in you.



<h3> <a name="gotsex">i've got the sex</a></h3>
<h6>originally the first track on sweden...</h6>
crushing strawberries one by one
watching the juice drip down
two and a half months ahead of schedule
the leaves on the trees are turning brown
we got ready for winter, as the sun rose up in the sky
there was something almost soothing in the hard to define
note of terror in your eye

watching the strawberries lose their shape 
as the wind blew threw the elm tree
the wind was far too cold for the middle of april
and you reached out your hand to me
it was good to feel your hand in mine
it was good to know you felt the pull too
i scooped up a palmfull of strawberry pulp
and smeared it all over you

the wild strawberries drove me on, as i lapped them up off of your skin
and i could feel your basal body temperature rise as the cold came in
hey hey hey hey...

<h3> <a name="shower">shower</a> </h3> 
the blackest storm i ever saw
was coming in from omaha
and the latest news from tokyo was a lot of ugly numbers
i was checkin' pay phones for forgotten coins
as the clouds came over west des moines
got into the house
got the curtains drawn
got into the the shower with all my clothes on
hey! hey! let the water come down!
hey! hey! let the water come down!

by noon it was clear that winter'd come
and i just the the water run
and i got sop suds in my eyes
and it stung like iodine
the phone started ringing like a fire alarm
and the voice on the machine was brutally calm
new numbers coming down the wire
got into the shower with my eyes on fire
hey! hey! let it fall on me, 
let it all come down relentlessly!
you swore that you would stick around 
when days like this started coming down!
break out the crystal!
get out the good champagne!
we're going down.... in flames.


<h3> <a name="carsong">the car song</a> </h3>
the highway's open and the sun is full
and the vinyl upholstery heats up like worsted wool
the hills roll past us, then they rear up again
take a deep breath now, and count to ten
i reach across the the stick shift and i pull you near
the highway's open and it's hot in here, 
it's hot in here.

your skin sends all the sunlight back to hell
and you smile in the coming darkness and i guess it's just as well
but there's no one left. 
there's no one left at all.
and then the hills behind your eyes 
start burning like a solid wall
of licking flames
they burn red and clear
the highway's open and it's hot in here, 
it's hot in here.


<h3> <a name="dollsong">the doll song</a> </h3>
i've got seven little dolls
in a bag
and i tell the dolls my troubles
and the dolls say "nag! nag! nag! nag!
is that all you ever do?
is that all you're capable of?"
and i say to the little dolls
you have no compassion 
baby, i'm talking to inanimate objects over you
i'm talking to inanimate objects over you

i started reading the bible
I corinthians 13
where paul talks all about love
but i don't know what he means
because he says that love is kind
that hasn't been my experience
so i set the bible on the kitchen table
and yelled at it until i was unable yeah
i'm talking to inanimate objects over you
i'm talking to inanimate objects over you
i'm talking to inanimate objects over you
i'm talking to inanimate objects over you

<h3> <a name="newmath">new math</a> </h3>
if you ever get money, print books
if you ever get money, print books
if nobody reads them, that's ok
if nobody hears what you have to say, that's ok
 
if you sell a few books, buy land
if you sell a few books, buy land
if no one come to visit you that's all right
if no one comes to visit you and you get lonely at night, that's all right
 
when you've built up your small house, settle in
when you've built up your strong home, settle in
take down the books that you once put away
wait for the memories to bloom, in your cold room.

(thanks to chris calvert for the above)


<a name="hippolytine"><h3> that hippolytine feeling </h3></a>
we sat together on the porch,
as the sunset bled.
and you playfully levelled your semi-automatic handgun right at my head.
and then god, in another stroke of his genius,
he opened up the floodgates.
and the bulls came out.
and the bulls came out.

we heard the heavy hooves beating on the earth
as the moment came near.
i felt the chamber of your pistol kissing my jaw.
i felt your red lips brushing my ear.
and then god, convincing if not transparent in his motives,
he opened up the floodgates.
but the rivers were dry, 'cause it was late august.
and the bulls came out.
and the bulls came out.



<a name="oslo"><h3> oslo 1888 </h3></a>
the snow built up around the smokehouse.
the sun shone on the snow.
and the sun's rays were blistering against my eyes.
the long night was well on its way
so i made good use of what was left of the daylight
walking out toward the main street
and coming back home again.
sleeping, i sang a short song about you.
and i knew every word of that song was true.
well, almost every word.

ice froze the green stems of the daffodils
ice formed carrots on my window sill.
i was blistering, blazing away.
and it had always been my tendency to let things slide,
but i went to the window with my eyes open wide.
and you were taking on perspective,
coming to ward the door.
you want some more?
i've got some more for you.
i've got just what you're looking for.


<a name="cathedral"><h3> cathedral song </h3></a>
<h6>by tanita tikaram</h6>
i saw you from the cathedral.
you were watching me.
and i saw from the cathedral
what i could be.
so take my time,
and take my lies.

and i watch you with a basic instinct.
it's the same for you.
you stand here, with your hand 
it's all laced and
what would you make me do?
so take my time,
yeah and take my lies.
take my time.

serious for the winter time
to wrench my soul
whole cotton, whole cotton ears
but i know there must be,
i know there must be,
i know there must be a place to go.

you saw me in the cathedral.
well i'm an ancient heart.
but you saw me in the cathedral.
well here we are just falling apart.
you catch me.
i am tired.
i want all that you are.

and i saw you from the cathedral.
you were leaving me.
yeah i saw from the cathedral.
you couldn't see the forest for the trees.
so take my time,
and take my lies.
take my time.
take my time.
take my time.
take my time.
take my time.
take my time.


<a name="spiritlake"><h3> going to spirit lake </h3></a>
why did you say what you said when the hummingbird vanished from sight?
a sudden, swelling heat in the dark october night.
you laughed and your eyes were alive,
and i knew that the moment had finally arrived.
and i reached out and held for your hand and held on tight.
you said the right thing.
you fixed everything
as the stars formed a canopy over spirit lake.
you said what you said.
the stars grew softer overhead.
i was on fire.
i was on fire for you.


<a name="onefineday"><h3> one fine day </h3></a>
<h6>i think this is a chiffons song</h6>
one fine day you'll look at me,
and you will know our love was meant to be.
yeah one fine day you're gonna want me for your own.
those arms i've yearned for will open wide,
and you'll be proud to have me right by your side.
yeah one fine day you're gonna want me for your own.

and though i know the kind of girl
who only wants to run around,
i'll keep waiting and someday darling,
you'll come around when you want to settle down.

yeah one fine day we'll meet onece more,
and you're gonna want the love you threw away before.
yeah one fine day you're gonna want me for your own.
yeah!



<a name="152"><h3> 15-2 </h3></a>
those may be the most beautiful shades of red i've ever seen.
those may be the most beautiful shades of red i've ever seen.
but don't be fooled.
if the sun goes down us here tonight,
it's not gonna be alright anymore.

none of this has anything really to do with us, that's my belief.
as the desert sky throws the glowing neon into bold relief.
your mouth is open and your thighs (eyes?) are wide.
hold on because it's dark outside now.

the smell of roses comes thickly through the open window now.
the smell of roses comes thickly through the open window now.
as the darkness closes in, our bodies draw the roses in.
and those may be the most beautiful shades of red i've ever seen.



<a name="60nomore"><h3> sure do love you baby, but i can't do 60 no more </h3></a>
they moved down here and you came down too
where the surf's always wild and the skies are blue.
got my blood pressure measured down in pajo key.
one sixty-five over one twenty-three.
and the lights are low over pompano beach tonight.
and one light is flickering out for the last time.

coconuts growing in the coconut tree,
surf and turf and sand and sea.
down here in the wreckage, just us three,
him and you.
you and me.
and the lights are low over pompano beach tonight.
and one light is flickering out,
out for the last time.



<a name="santacruz"><h3> somebody else's parking lot in sebastopol</h3></a>
<h6>Originally titled <u>somebody else's parking lot in santa cruz</u></h6>
outside the opera house in sydney,
i saw my life come crashing to its end.
i cried out to the scale-tipper
on whom all living things depend.
strings of giuseppe verdi suffused the evening air.
i wished, i wished, i wished that god would kill me,
instead of leaving me alone to see you standing there
before me. that sad look on your face.
you took me to so many places i never thought i'd go.
this is the worst place.

yeah we did our manners proud
on the night we said goodbye.
no big scene out there on the sidewalk,
as we pinpointed the place where all good things go to die.
i know you hate it when i get my headaches.
well, i've got a real prize tonight.
listening to katia ricciarelli,
it's not going to be alright.
and i'd like to think that this will pass, this will pass.
i know it's not the case.
of all the highs and lows and middle-ends you brought me to,
this is the worst place.



<a name="kirby"><h3> going to kirby sigston </h3></a>
we boarded up the windows.
and we sealed the door shut.
and we let the special chicken build a nest right by the window.
your face was glowing.
the heat was strong.
we ate cold black eggs all day long
in the winter when the wind kicked up.

i saw your body moving through the incandescent light.
you were dancing by yourself there.
your sweater hugged your shoulders and it was alright.
we plucked sugar crystals from the cold english air.
i had a present for ya hidden down there
in the winter when the wind kicked up.



<a name="union"><h3> there is power in a union </h3></a>
<h6> originally: lyrics: billy brag music: traditional</h6>
there is a power in a factory.
there is power in the land.
there is power in the hand of the worker.
but it all amounts to nothing if together we don't stand.
yeah, there is power in a union.

the union forever!
defending our rights!
down with the blackleg!
all workers unite!
with our brothers and our sisters from many far-off lands,
yeah, there is power in a union!

now i long for the morning when they realize
brutality and unjust laws cannot defeat us.
but who'll defend the wokrers who cannot organize,
when the bosses send their lackeys out to cheat us?

yeah, money speaks for money!
the devil for his own!
who stands to speak for the skin and the bone?
what a comfort to the widow, a light to the child,
yeah, there is power in a union!

<a name="poltergeist"><h3> poltergeist </h3></a>
i can't stand it when you tell our infant son
that he was born beneath a bad sign.
and i can't stand it when smiles up at you
just because you're his mother.
and i can't stand the bitter thing that i've become
beneath the four walls that hold up our ceiling.
and i wonder when the house gets real quiet
who between us will be the first one to give into the feeling.
and i know you don't want me to hurt you tonight.
and i, i don't want you to hurt me the way you do.

i can't stand it when you put the boy to bed and ya
sing him those songs i used to sing to you.
yeah i can't stand to hear you sing those songs
when you know you don't mean them.
and i can't stand the way my body still remembers 
how much we used to mean to one another way back when.
and i can't stand going back to seek the shelter of your arms.
and then i can't stand it again.
and i know you don't want me to hurt you tonight.
and i, i don't want you to hurt me the way you do.


<a name="maris"><h3> song for roger maris </h3></a>
when the power of god shows up in your swing,
and the people start to notice and you can't do anything about it
and they all come out to see you. 
they start to crowd around.
let me tell ya brother, you can feel it coming down.
and i got an angel watching over me,
a monkey on my back,
the devil at my heels,
reporters breathing down my neck.

yeah my daddy always to me to finish what ya start.
my wife's about to leave me and it's going to break my heart.
and i no longer have my youth.
i no longer have my looks.
i got a god damned one-way ticket to the god damned history books.
and i got an angel watching over me,
a monkey on my back,
the devil at my heels,
reporters breathing down my neck.
hey, hey.



<a name="0275"><h3> 02-75 </h3></a>
i got your letter.
and i read what it said.
and i blushed with recognition at every word you said.
and you are my best friend.
and i have always known you.

i came to your house.
and i looked around.
and i felt the real rain falling down.
and you are my best friend.
and i have always known you.



<a name="pirates"><h3>pirates (so long lonely avenue)</h3></a>
<h6>this song by ricky lee jones</h6>
come on - joey get out of school
we got places to go
a '67 lincoln you got a radio that hurts
and the girls like to touch it
just to find out if it works
It wasn't me
don't look at me

joey live on the edge of the corner
of living on the run
i like to ride in the middle
i'm just tryin to have some fun
until the pirates come
until the pirates come to take me

and i won't need a pilot
got a pirate who might sail
somewhere far away i heard
you answer me
so i'm holding on
to your rainbow sleeves

well, goodbye boys,
oh my buddy boys,
oh my sad-eyed sinatras
it's a cold globe around the sea
you can keep the coat that I bought ya
and i know you'll get the chance to make it
and nothin's gonna stop you
you just reach right out and take it
and you'll say - so long, lonely avenue
yeah you'll say so long lonely avenue



<a name="things"><h3>my favorite things</h3></a>
champagne bubbled up through the nick of the bottle,
and sweet silence came out through the radio.
it was john coltrane.
god damn it, i love john coltrane!

you danced across the living room floor, 
and you kissed me once and then you kissed me some more.
you had your arms wrapped around my neck and it felt real fine,
and then your ankle knocked up against mine.
and resonating in my bones
was the precise crisp drumming of mr. elvin jones.
god damn it, i love john coltrane!



<a name="agemos"><h3>agemo's hoops</h3></a>
you were breathing against my throat
covering your laugh up with your long black overcoat
all circles warming up.
and you told me what you were going to do.
and i promised to do the same thing too.
and the air, the air in new england was pure
poison.

the car was parked out back among the trees.
your voice was getting higher by slow degrees.
you were giving me directions.
and you told me where i came from.
well, god bless us everyone.
and the air, the air in new england was pure
poison.
poison.
poison.
poison.



<a name="moonsong"><h3>the moon song</h3></a>
the moon shining, 
three hours into the best part of the day and
i want to tell you that you're so pretty and 
the words come out wrong and the rage gets in the way..
dead quiet you looked at me like you were looking into space.
yeah, in space noone could hear you say good bye.
but down here i shouldn't have to read it on your face.
that's not normal.
that's not right.
that's not very nice.
no, it isn't.

the moon shining down on your body.
you look so nice.
and i want to tell you, but you don't want to hear it,
and i know. you don't have to tell me twice.
but, once would be civil. the moon shining.
i got it in my brain, and i had so much to say but there was dead quiet.
you were silent. three hours -- into the best part of the day.

<a name="trash"><h3>trash</h3></a>
<h6>this is a suede song</h6>
maybe, maybe it's the clothes we wear,
our tasteless bracelets and the dye in our hair,
maybe it's our kookiness.
or maybe, maybe it's our nowhere towns,
our nothing places and our cellophane sounds,
maybe it's our looseness.

but we're trash, you and me.
we're the litter on the breeze.
we're the people on the streets.
we're trash, me and you.
it's in everything we do.
it's in everything we do.

maybe, maybe it's the things we say,
the places we go and the music we play,
maybe it's our cheapness.
or maybe, maybe it's the times we've had,
the lazy days and the crazes and the fads,
maybe it's our sweetness.
but we're trash, you and me.
we're the litter on the breeze.
we're the people on the street.
we're trash, me and you.
it's in everything we do.
it's in everything we do.



<a name="bridlington"><h3>going to bridlington</h3></a>
stopped by for the coffee and cake that you promised.
saw your porch light on.
saw your wire-haired terrier lazing on the lawn.
came right in through the front door.
went right down the main hall.
turned right into the kitchen.
there you were alright.
the moon was rising over bridlington.
and you had blood all over your hands.
someone was singing in the yard next door.
and you had blood all over your hands.

sat down on the kitchen floor.
looked up at you.
saw you smoothing down your skirt around your thighs.
wondered what good that was supposed to do.
and i saw you pull your hair back.
saw you messing with your earrings.
saw you trying to smile.
hey! you don't have to smile for me.
the moon was rising over bridlington.
and you had blood all over your hands.
something was cracking in the rafters of our house. 
and you had blood all over your hands.
the moon was rising over bridlington.
the moon was rising over bridlington.
the moon was rising.



<a name="wishing"><h3>wishing the house would crash</h3></a>
i was standing outside with my hands in the air.

you were there at the window.
you are a god damned liar.
let the house come down on me.

<a name="shoreline"><h3>song from the shoreline</h3></a>
through the bodies of a hundred people, i saw you.

i couldn't hear a sound.
in the bodies of a hundred people, i saw you.
i saw you coming through the crush.
i saw you pushing through.

<a name="letter"><h3>letter from a motel</h3></a>
the beams we used to build our house are breaking at last.
the building will not hold together very much longer.
my arms are young, and they can do the work if called upon to do so.
but the house itself has weakened and it's tilting on its axis.

in the picture that you sent, i could see the windows getting soft.
and i could see the heat had gotten straight out of hand.
and i knew that none of this is what you'd been meaning to send along.
i did not mean to say what i'm saying now if we're gonna talk about what intentions were.
but the house itself is weak, very weak,
though you and our three daughters believe in what you want to believe.
from where i stand stability is everything.
in the room i'm standing in stability is everything.
and in this world, in this world stability is everything.
from where i'm standing right now stability is everything.



<a name="maya"><h3>you're in maya</h3></a>
he hit me right in the face.
i drove the falcon uptown.
hung out in the library parking lot.
the swelling'll never go down.
tied a hiram walker in the lining of my father's old corduroy coat.
big, big plans hatching in my brain and a
big ugly lump in my throat.
i drove up to harvey mudd and i played pinball
'till i didn't want to kill anyone.
polished off all my cheap whiskey and stepped out into the california sun.
singing bainne na mo is a gamna,
and the juice of the barley for me.
singing bainne na mo is a gamna,
and the juice of the barley for me.

my thirst carried me up the coast,
where it only got sharper god damn it.
in a small room that got even smaller a block away from the wilamette.
there was nowhere i needed to go.
and nowhere i wanted to be.
from my window looked out upon nothing.
and nothing looked right back at me.
i had a couple of things on my mind.
a couple of problems to think through.
and i drank 'till i couldn't see straight anymore --
until there was nothing to drink to.
singing bainne na mo is a gamna,
and the juice of the barley for me.
singing bainne na mo is a gamna,
and the juice of the barley for me.
hey!



<a name="drink"><h3>i think i'll just stay here and drink</h3></a>
<h6>this is a hank williams song</h6>
i could be holding you tonight.
i could quit doing wrong and strt doing right.
you don't care about what i think.
i think i'll just stay here and drink.

you're hurtin' me now, don't square the deal.
at least you'll know the way i feel.

ain't no woman gonna change the way i think.
i think i'll just stay here and drink.

hurtin' ya now won't mean a thing.

but the wallpaper's melting, thoughts turning blue.
the lightbulb is giving out shots in the dark
and the mad clarinets run away with your heart.

remember that old tune.
the one that you cried to when you fell.
yeah it felt like you'd lost your mind.

you were not twenty-one when he first saw you.
how his melody cheered you, pitch rang so true.
placed your lips to the mouthpiece, struck out a part,
now the mad clarinets run away with your heart.

do you remember that old tune?
the one that you cried to when you fell.
it felt like you'd lost your mind.

when you left that sucker on a moonlit night.
you didn't bother looking left or you wouldn't look right.
you nearly got run over by a ten ton truck.
got your pride you tried to make out like you...

when he received you, your hope simply fell through.
so you cried.
yeah it felt like you'd lost your mind.

and every word we sang i knew was true.

are you crazy?
are you high?
or just an ordinary guy?
have you done all you can do?
are you with me doctor?

i was waiting for the taste you said you'd bring to me.
biscane bay, where the cuban gentleman sleep all day.
i went searching for the song you used to sing to me.
and katie lies.
you can see it in her eyes.
so imagine my surprise when i saw you.

<a name="pennsylvania"><h3>pennsylvania dutch treat</h3></a>
brought in the old furnishings from mussel shoals.
up here they burn a lot of brown coal.
and the cars all run on diesel fuel.
the wind comes in from hills to the east,
blowing thirty miles an hour at least.
and the clear blue horizon is smooth and cool.
and the house is like a relic of days gone by.
and it's kinda hard to take, but i try.
i've got a deep need to communicate.
i want so badly to set things straight.
but i can't seem to concentrate deep in the heart of the quaker state.

i had the bed sent in from the west coast.
watched the moving men carry in the old ghosts.
and the purple-ink sky swelled up like a pregnant woman.
saw the lights go up in town.
on the back porch it began to cool down.
but in here, in here, in here it was hotter than an oven.
and the way my blood began to froth and foam,
made it feel just like home.
i've got a deep need to communicate.
i want so badly to set things straight.
but i something tells me it's way too late deep in the heart of the quaker state.

my brother said not to waste another thin dime because
he ain't comin' out next time, and you can
soak in a bathtub full of gasoline, but you will
never get your hands clean.
yeah the building was raging fire was glowing within
you ran out to save your own skin, and
well, i probably shouldn't blame you.

and you all think i'm making this part up,

or telling little jokes to amuse myself with

radical colors on the eastern sky,
the blinding symmetry,
the little white lie,
your small hand waving in the cold air,
the ridges of the mountain frozen on the skyline there.
when the sun came out over norway today,
i saw you going away.
there was nothing good in your going.

i cut the flowers that grew near the door
and i arranged them in the center of the floor.

you swept past my face like an eclipse.

you act like i'm your chum and i can treat you like my little sister.
but if you cover the sun with your thumb you can't expect to get a fever blister.
and if the air is filled with a sickening hum,
don't be upset or overcome.
don't worry. 
it's just the irony engine working.

you rose like a crane to the occasion.
you froze at the very implication.
you chose to divert the whole invasion.
by winking and shrugging and smiling and giving me an awkward seatbelt hug
before you vanished in the chilly autumn.
i could feel the motor chug.
something tearing loose and striking bottom.
and if you still can't see how a three point plug
could superheat on the lunar tug.
don't worry.
it's just the irony engine working.
yeah don't worry.

I woke up this morning, 
my new girlfriend beside me.
I don't have to lie about her.
I don't need some dumb story to hide me.
she turned 20 last April, she's as tall as I am,
she came to this country all the way from Siam.
I may not be the greatest guy in this town,
people may have good cause to put me down,
but I've got a real good girlfriend now.

we stood on Chicago Avenue, 
hey look--here comes the bus.
slipped on a solid sheet of ice, (???)
watched the number 66 fly right past us.

I told you I was never going back,
I was trying to breathe evenly, 
when the phone stopped ringing for the first time in a long time,
and you flashed that smile at me.
and then you opened up the window, 
I felt the air roll in,
in the place where the world stops forever,
in the place where your body begins.

you  were staring out at the street below. 
there was nobody there. 
they built fire down there in the alley.
I saw the fires rising everywhere.
and then you opened up the window, 
the north wind began to blow.
we were just a few short hours from something really special
and I heard you singing soft and low.

<h6>this is an outtake from "All Hail West Texas"</h6>
let the stars come out, and the moon shine bright
we're sleeping on the porch tonight
wind blew all the power lines down
watch where you step if you go walking around

this may be the night
our bodies fill with light
and we may hover above
the surface of
our warm, lonely planet

let cooling rains come, let them fall
let the grass grow strong and tall
let the dandelions breed
give me what you know I need

this may be the night
our bodies fill with light
and we may hover above
the surface of
our warm, lonely planet



<h3><a name="god">song for god</a></h3>
<h6>this is an outtake from "All Hail West Texas"</h6>
neighbor kids running across the front yard this evening
sun going down, wind gathering strength
the state i live in is the largest of its kind
it takes two days or better to drive across its length

if you try to come and find me, i will know you're coming
there's an old fallout shelter i can hide in
i won't even be able to hear their hoofbeats
when the horsemen ride in

another mild winter -- time seems to stand still
the sky swallows up the city like a tent
tiny breezes razor patterns in the dust
no way of saying what they're supposed to represent

i have come to where i've come to now
always abiding in you
if you try to find me now I'll be invisible to everything
when the horsemen come riding on through

A Note from Mr. Darnielle:
"Song For God" was cut largely because while the lyric clearly 
reads "it takes two days or better to drive across its length," 
the singer of the recording in question has inexplicably chosen 
to modify that to read "it takes two days or better to walk 
across its length." I challenge anyone foolhardy enough to 
try it to see whether Texas can in fact be walked in two days. I 
would hazard to guess that it can't be done.

a new covenant -- a real sharp one.
and we spend all our days and nights
gaining new appreciation of its finer points.

waiting for jesus to come along and save us. and we are
biding our time.

where the texas doughboys used to play
before the wind blew everything away.
where we came to get away from our friends.
where we'd tell each other jokes waiting for the world to end.
we know our jokes are funny,
but in all the wrong ways and for all the wrong reasons.
and we watch old george romero movies

we were becoming what we are:
collapsing stars.

when we chewed up children's tylenol like bubble gum
till our hearts were beating deep and rich as kettle drums
we knew if we waited long enough the change would come
and then the day did come and at last

hold tight, hold fast, catch lightning in a jar:
collapsing stars

told you to load up on provisions
we wouldn't be back for awhile
pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
turn toward the camera and smile, smile, smile

when we ditched the plan to poison all our enemies
tucked our weapons in a clearing and covered them with leaves
we are gonna come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves one day - 
well, we are on our way

you can look but you won't find another love like ours:
collapsing stars

i'm not going to say what i came over to say to you.
but you were thinking along the same lines
and you let the words come ringing through.

i wouldn't've said that to you.
i wouldn't say it if they paid me to.

you got no manners
you got no manners at all
you got no manners
you got no manners
you got no manners at all
you got no manners

i'm going to try real hard,
but i, i can't believe that you're really going to do it
it's like one of those chinese kites flying in the wind
and then some kid with a shotgun sends a bullet through it.

and i, i  came here to say it,
but i've done that before.
but i've never, um, told you that i don't love you anymore.

you got no manners.
you got no manners at all.
you got no manners.
you got no manners.
you got no manners at all.

come down in the flatland
show me your shoulder
wait now where the black hand touches us 
we'll both grow older

and the sky above us
and the ground beneath us
and the air around us
and the ocean to the right

measure your arm length
i can't live without it
i treasure those thirty inches
i want to talk about it.

and the sky above us
and the ground beneath us
and the air around us
and the ocean to the right

love you in the cold air
your long hair makes me shiver
above you i see the sun
light up every sliver

i don't like what i've turned into
there's a hole in my chest in the spot that you wormed out through
they say it's on the mend,
but it hurts me when i bend, yeah.

and i saw you down at angie's place
that rippling smile on your perfect face
well it really doesn't suit you.
when i see it i want to shoot you, sorry.

and i don't like what you said to me.
i don't like what you said to me.
but i guess i'll have to deal with it
let the bullet hit me and i just reel with it,

<h3><a name="etiquette">etiquette song</a></h3>
rain washing your memory away.
fires burning somewhere around here.
clouds forming, clouds gathering.
one minute in a long, long year.
you've got one good reason for doing what you're going to do.
i've got one thing holding me back from doing the same thing to you.

in the san gabriels the fire ate away
rabbit rush and the jimson weed.
when the rain came it was like an old friend.
when you came by you had just what i needed.

you've got one hour left before something happens alright?
and the then rain will come down tonight.



<h3><a name="crystal">pure crystal</a></h3>
the cactus cuttings took root,
the tea you brought me smacked of passion fruit.
in a room where the heat bled in though the wall,
i let breathing in the design of it all
what is there to regret?
your mouth was wet.
and your shoulders rolled under mine.

i saw the glaze come over your eyes.
i felt my blood pumping and the heat rise.
i've seen pretty eyes before, but never like those
and your body open like a new rose
what more is there to say?
the air gave way.
i was melting and sweltering under you.




<h3><a name="radical">radical evil song</a></h3>

i know that you are the radical evil.
i've been wondering about.

i read the words the clouds spell on the sky.
i watch them burn up.
then i see you turn up in the corner of the room.
i knew you'd be stopping by soon.

'cause you are the radical evil.
i've been wondering about.
i know that you are the radical evil
i've been wondering about.

and you hang around for six or seven hours and then you get ready to go.
well, i remember when you used to kiss me without me asking you to.
yeah i remember when you used to.

when i lean toward to you, you turn away.
it's a quarter past one a.m. on a warm saturday.
that's alright, that's alright, i hear you.
don't do anything you don't want to do.
but, i remember when you used to kiss me without me asking you to.
yeah i remember when you used to.



<h3><a name="flower">flower song</a></h3>
selling new flowers,
outrageously cheap.
freshly cut daisies,
twenty five cents each.
you loved me when you could keep your losses down
but winter's coming around now.
now, now, now.

the girl at the flower shop
is kind and young.
she made accurate change for me.
i let the change come.
you loved me when it was cheap to do so.
can you feel the cold wind blow now?
now, now now.



<h3><a name="delhi">i meant every word i said in new delhi</a></h3>

they don't do much for you.
i know you see the fires raging
baby, i see them too
and even though
you got your options all lined up in a row
there is something i want you to know.
i meant every word i said in new delhi.
every word.
every word.
every word.

i don't know where you're going,
and i don't want to know either.
i know you're heading north.
i know you've kept the keys in your pocket
breathe in, i see the moon shining down you
i know that you remember.
i can see it burning though.
in sanskrit, they got a word for it.

<h3><a name="bastards">slimy rich white bastards</a></h3>
you took over alexander hall because you wanted to protest racism.
and you took over alexander all because you thought more of a certain color ought to be hired
you slimy, rich, white bastards
you slimy, rich, white bastards

well your parents sent you out from the east coast
because they were very, very tired of having you proselytize around the house
when you were only sixteen years old
they were willing to spend twenty-one thousand dollars 
a year plus whatever other money you needed for gas
and expensive snacks
and meals out
and weekends in TJ
you slimy, rich, white bastards
you slimy, rich, white bastards
you slimy, rich, white bastards



<h3><a name="compunction">alpha compunction</a></h3>
you will not call my memory into question.
you will not question my memory.
see there was you and me up on a hilltop by ourselves
and then the red clouds dispersing above me
i should have killed myself
when i found out how beautiful you are.
but everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

as the afternoon sky opened up its mouth
and the air cooled down one or two degrees
i felt the world within me screaming to come out
and then i looked up at you and your hair spilled down over me.

i felt you breathing on me and i heard your voice.
your eyes were twin bonfires and your lips were moist.
i should have killed myself
when i found out how beautiful you are.
but everyone makes mistakes sometimes.



<h3><a name="malted">malted milk</a></h3>
two weeks later you asked me what did i do
right after i got the great big brush-off from you.
well i checked my pulse and i caught my breath.
and i, i guess you know what happens next.
i sat down and i drank my malted milk.
i sat down and i drank my malted milk.

you, you say, you say i'm easily appeased.
but you, you don't know the feeling that shoots through me.
with a tall glass of malted milk
cold as ice, smooth as silk.
i sit down and i try real hard to forget 
that you, you and i ever met.

yesterday you came over
and you found me stretched out on the sofa.
and you said you were gonna call a medic
'cause i looked so pathetic.
well i ain't there smiling brightly staring at you.
malted milk in my hand, still as a statue.
i sat down and i drank my malted milk.
i sat down and i drank my malted milk.
i sat down and i drank my malted milk.
i sat down and i drank my malted milk.



<h3><a name="france">going to france</a></h3>
you say it's too cold over there anyway
it's far too cold.
i'm going to france.
and i'm taking you with me.

wild berries, wild sheep
you know you want to see them.
and i'm going to france.
and i'm taking you with me.

we always said one day we were going there.
well, i don't know about you,
but i keep my promises.
and i'm going to france.

<h3><a name="church1">history of the church (part 1)</a></h3>
in the early days of the christian church
there was a movement among free thinking christians called gnosticism.
now the gnostics believed that the incarnation of christ had been completely illusory
and their reasoning was as follows:
that if god is holy and the body is unholy,
then god would not inhabit a body.
hence people had been seeing things when christ walked the earth.

now about this this time lived a man named polycarp.
polychar had received his teaching at the hands of john the apostle.
it was polycarp's earnest belief that the gnostics were heretics
and he visited rome to tell them so.

he met up with a guy named marcion
extremely influential among the gnostics.
and marcion, realizing polycarp's status at having studied under john the apostle
demanded that he be recognized.
polycarp was about sixty years old and he extended an aging arm
and pointed toward marcion and said i recognize
i recognize
i recognize
the first born son of satan!

that was polycarp.



<h3><a name="kittens">kittens in mittens</a></h3>
the building shook with the sound of wild kittens,
and i grabbed my scarf and i pulled on my mittens,
took my coat and i went down
to the useless lot on the outskirts of town.
the dogs were howling.
the wind was blowing.
the birds were singing.
and i saw you.

your eyes as bright as burning coals,
but ask not for whom the bell tolls.
'cause it tolls for those who ask that question.
and it tolls for those who answer that question.
dogs were howling.
the birds were singing.
the wind was blowing.
and i saw you.



<h3><a name="cane">in the cane fields</a></h3>
i tasted the wet sugar on your lips
it brought me alive
songs blended unsurely
one another on the arms of the air,
we looked around the living room.
there was cool jazz on the stereo,
the sound was clean and clear.
i was ready to absorb you into myself,
my jaw was hanging open.
i got so hungry and i felt so drunk
i felt your muscles tighten and relax
and tighten and relax.
and tighten and relax.
and tighten.
and then relax.

i knew a cuban guy who worked can when he was young,
can you imagine it?
he said that the tension that it bred in his back was enough to make you laugh.
bending and rising sixteen hours a day,
we looked around the living room.
your sweating skin pressed on me and we were drowning.
and i don't want to hurt you anymore.



<h3><a name="babylon">rivers of babylon</a></h3>
meanwhile downstairs
i'm setting up shop
a little too proud
to let the matter drop

i can you see you up there,
isn't it romantic?
you're huffing and puffing
their chairs on the titanic
and i reach for a glass
of cool water drawn from the rivers of babylon.

meanwhile outside,
the stars have come out.
and the humid summer air
tugs at the ring in my snout.
and you come to the window,
and i spread wide my arms.
jump if you want to jump.
jump if you want to.
the water's warm.
me, i know.
i know 'cause i've been swimming.
blindly along through the rivers of babylon.



<h3><a name="brazil">going to brazil</a></h3>
you've got something magic in your eyes.

where they speak a language sorta like one i can speak.
i'm going to south america.

<h3><a name="browning">elizabeth barrett browning</a></h3>
i saw the building burning down.
i saw the dogs come running in two by two.
i saw the feast of saint christopher beginning.
i drew connecting lines between these things.

you say i need to get some sleep.
you say i need to take it easy for a while.
you say i'll never learn to swim at this rate,
but i'm waiting for you downstairs
and the water's rushing in on me.

so i guess the wheel's been set in motion.
i guess the ship, it's gone and left it's little harbor.
i guess we'll wait and see what happens to us next.
and i can't wait because there's rats in the walls.
there are rats in the walls.

<h3><a name="john435">john 4:35</a></h3>
there was a gas leak on a surface street somewhere
and we were stuck in traffic
and so i ran my fingers thorough your hair.
and the sun beat down through the windshield.
can you remember the heat?
and the taste of your tongue was thick and pure and impossibly sweet.
and the fields are white unto harvest.
the fields are white unto harvest now.
the fields are white unto harvest.
the fields are white unto harvest now.

the light turned red then green then yellow then red then green again
and i felt that shivering rippling feeling go through my spleen again.
and you leaned toward me.
and your sweat fell on my shoulder.
and i'm swimming back to that moment now before i get any older.
because the fields are white unto harvest.
the fields are white unto harvest now.
the fields are white unto harvest.
the fields are white unto harvest now.



<h3><a name="damned">going to some damned english city</a></h3>
your skirt was red and flowing,
your blouse was blue
on the night i locked eyes with you.
it seemed to me like i hadn't seen your eyes since last december.

my shredding muscles
my popping joints
i saw the pupils of your eyes by firelight shrinking down to pinpoints
you were poking at the embers
there's a cold wind coming off the ocean.
there's a cold wind coming off the ocean.

i wet my finger with my tongue and pressed it in the ashes,
rubbed it up against your perfect eyelashes.
you said something really important,
something pretty seems to have slipped my mind.
walls were freezing, so was the floor.
i didn't want to hurt you anymore.
you had a sad, sad, friend in front of you,
that dying fire behind.
there was a cold wind coming off the ocean.
there was a cold wind coming off the ocean.


<h3><a name="plague">the plague</a></h3>
there will be blue skies above the green and verdant plains.
churns will swell with fresh butter there will be an abundance of sweet grain.
and we will rise from our sleep. We won't have time to choose what things we'll keep.

and rivers will all turn to blood.
frogs will fall from the sky.
and the plague will rage through the countryside.

la la la la
la la la la
la la la, La la la, La la la

there will be cotton clouds above the fields as white as cream.
there will be loud singing in the churches as we all come out to take one for the team.
and all our great schemes and plans will slip like fishes from our hands.

and rivers will all turn to blood.
frogs will fall from the sky.
and the plague will cover the country with it's anger.

on humid evenings you have heard 
your neighbors making noises
that you wonder for awhile about
and then put off investigating

shrieks and squeals and high pitched whines

and we, we are your neighbors.

on hazy afternoons you heard 
your neighbors come and go
and maybe stay away a day or two
and then return appearing worse for wear.

scrubbed up and hollow-eyed
you tried your best to ignore us.

you see us at the grocery store.
you wonder what we're shopping for.
we lean against the Thermador.
eyes fixed firmly on the floor.

we found their cocoons in the garbage
we'll either stay high forever, crash in or out or two
sleeping the sleep of the blessed
picking through trashcans with you

the guy on t.v. is a prophet
you just have to look in his eyes
we'll either turn our lives over to christ or
We'll just drift off
trying to better ourselves
giving up after one or two tries

the high school's a front for the yakuza
everyone, everyone knows it
we will all shortly be richer than god if we'll just hold on
as long as we play all our cards right
as long as nobody here blows it
I've drawn up a map of the autumn
the holding tanks full for the night
I heard all about it on vitizen's band
it's a brand new day
we'll be awake until Thursday
the future's disarmingly bright

I am wrapped in scraps of linen and pieces of people's old shirts.
but way way underneath all these sticky bands, I hold all my dreams right here in my hands.

I will rise from the tomb like an infant emerging from the womb.

I spent several thousand years down here all alone.
no way to stand the lonely old ache in my bones.
say the spell three times, crank up the special effects,
I'm gonna cast off all my bandages and see what happens next.

I will rise fully formed like an infant freshly born.

I've been trapped too long, underneath the ground.
in the hollow darkness ain't no grave gonna hold my body down.
I will push my hand up through the earth and I will rise like the cry of an infant at it's birth.

you'll be sorry. you always feel sorry later on.
when you come around to say so, I will be gone.

took up the reins myself all for you
dug the spurs in clean down to the bone.

but all that comes later.

And the replica where my body used to be.

you can take it to the bank that he's gonna die some day
he's gonna die

maybe a few years before you do.
maybe a few years later.
what does it matter in the long run?

you know that girl who you told your secrets to back in high school
the one who faithfully broadcast all of them
throughout the generous pool of your mutual acquaintances 
and made it sound like you were psycho
and in need of professional help
yes, yes. yes you do remember.

well you can carry that grudge or you can let it go
but as sure as I'm singing this song you know
she's gonna die.
she's gonna die. Yes she will.

five'll get you ten. show me the same undignified end
that I will, and you will
and everyone we know.

it may happen 20 years down the line
or it may happen an hour from now
what does it matter?
what does it matter in the long run?

everyone who's done you wrong
everyone who's done you favors
everyone you like
everyone you can't stand the sight of

what does it matter?
what does it matter in the long run?

out behind the safeway just before the flood
huffed some cans of spray paint
and begin to vomit blood.
one more night in this town
is gonna break me I just know.
hang on to your dreams 'til someone makes you let them go.

stumbled on down indian hill,
tail between my legs.
sick taste in my mouth
folger's crystals and hard boiled eggs
if I can't run away tonight
I don't know what I'll do
hang on to your dreams 'til someone beats them out of you.

do what you have to do.
go where you have to go.
when the time comes to loosen up your grip, you'll know.

called my friend in new york
three thousand miles away
half way through her metamorphosis, nothing I could say.
poured my small resentments like rare and priceless gems
hang on to your dreams until there's nothing left of them.

them wild-eyed boys that had been away

friday night they'll be dressed to kill

the drink will flow and blood will spill
and if the boys want to fight, you'd better let them.

you came to california.
you left houston by night.
and you looked around anaheim, there was nothing there.
and your fastball has been clocked at better than a hundred miles an hour.
even so, yesterday they let you go.

on the plane home you get them to give you a seat alone,
and when the stewardess comes by
you feel the fire flashing on your eyes
because just between the badge and the belt you can see the strike zone.
yeah, just between the badge and the belt you can see the strike zone.
but you gotta stop thinking that way.
it's ten fifteen on a tuesday morning
and the sky through the cabin window is bright and powder blue.



<h3><a name="washing">washing my face</a></h3>
when you come, if you come
make sure you bring some bubble gum.
and a great big bottle of cheap gin, yeah
don't bother knocking, you can just waltz right in.

when you come, if you do come by
make sure you wear your skirt real high.
there's cracked ice in the freezer
and glasses in the sink
you can lie down on the sofa, and I'll fix us both a drink.
and we will teach ourselves to pray in languages
that we don't really speak.
and we will lie about the way it used to be.

when you come, if you come
bring a couple of coconuts and i'll supply the rum.
and i will dim the lights, pull all the drapes
throw in those near forgotten video tapes.
yeah when you come, if you make it out this far
you better leave your pride out in the car.
and you wanna make sure that you bring along some means for forgetting where it was that we went wrong.
and we will teach ourselves to pray in languages
that we don't really speak.
and we will lie about the way it used to be.



<h3><a name="survive">i will survive</a></h3>
<h6>Originally by Gloria Gaynor</h6>
first I was afraid
I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live
without you by my side
but then I spent so many nights
just feeling sorry for myself
and I grew strong
and I learned how to carry on
and now you're back
from outer space
I just walked in to find you here
with that sad look upon your face
I should have that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
if I had known for just one second
you'd be back to bother me

go on now go walk out the door
just turn around now
'cause you're not welcome anymore
weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
did you think I'd crumble
did you think I'd lay down and die
well no, not I
I will survive
yeah, as long as i know how to live
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
and I've got all my love to give
and I'll survive
I will survive
hey hey



<h3><a name="bigunit">the big unit</a></h3>
I sunk all of my money into swiss gold
and I watched the markets slide
and I stood on the edge of the pacific
and watched the hypodermic needles coming in with the tide
there are two guys just outside of chicago looking for me tonight,
but randy johnson throws a baseball 97 miles an hour and I'm gonna be alright.

I had a fully loaded junk bond portfolio that
didn't work out like it was supposed to
there's a mountain of money in the bond market
that I can't seem to get close to
I've been headed down the road to ruin.
the end is nowhere in sight.

<h3><a name="michigan">going to michigan</a></h3>
as the car rolled north towards michigan you complained
that all i like to listen to is gary neuman and the tubeway army
well maybe that's true
but what about you
and the blue cheer comprehensive retrospective box set
that's pretty annoying too.
the wing window flew open.
the air was thin.
i heard you say so and i heard
shadings of meaning again
and your fingers touched mine
and that supersonic whine began
near the back of my head
and the white rose burned.
you know exactly what i mean about the burning white rose
yes you do
yes you do



<h3><a name="river">the river song</a></h3>
the little river is blue and long
i sat by the side of it as everything went wrong
i got a letter from the dry city's heart
you say the water distribution system's come all apart
and my place here's threatened
but i had it in my mind
and your face was on the skyline, so sweet and so kind
let them come, let 'em all come down.
let them take a good long look around.
let them see if my rivers won't suit them.
let them drown.

the fish that swim there in the current
with their machine-like faces should be no deterrant
they'll all come toward me 
and i won't move
i know where i stand, i have nothing to prove
because i had it in my heart that you were walking by
and the little river's waters became our separate skies
so let them come, let 'em all come down.
let them take a good long look around.
let them see if my rivers won't suit them.
let them drown.

'cause i had it in my heart that you were walking by
and the whole world dissolved leaving only you and i.
so let them come, let 'em all come down.
let them take a good long look around.
let them see if my rivers won't suit them.
let them drown.

i knew you were on your way back
well in baltimore, you will find what you've been waiting for
in baltimore, you will find what you've been waiting for

just beyond the last of the sidewalk, where the beach begins
i heard the airplanes announcing the apocolypse
saw the 737's coming on in
will you hold on for just a minute
will you hold on while i catch my breath
listen, in baltimore, you'll uncover what you've been digging for
in baltimore, you will find what you've been waiting for

yeah, when they run out of options.

there's the faith you can give or withhold
and then there's the one true faith
there's the revolution you came for
and the one you're eventually going to get.
and there's a road that starts right here and leads clear up to saskatchewan
and i brought a full tank and a '67 mustang.
and this is a song for your young women to whistle
while they're driving at high speeds down the highway

the wind up in the trees
the song on the wind
there's a mesage in the song
but the message is hopelessly complicated
and the words on water

<a name="marrakesh"><h3> going to marrakesh </h3></a>
the fog is lifting from the water.
the bells are sounding on the boats.
and our love is a monster plain and simple.
though you weight it down with stones to try to drown it,
it floats.
it floats.

the day of reckoning is coming
faster than anyone here realizes.
and our love is like jesus, but worse.
though you seal the cave up where you've lain its body,
it rises.
it rises.

i keep waiting for our love to die.
the machines by its bed dim and flicker, but it won't stay dead.
and it perks up when the nurses bring its medication by.

i wish our love could go the way of all flesh.
but it's not right, and its not nice
to try and kill the same thing twice.
would you pack your things?
we are going to marrakesh.



<a name="adultery"><h3>adultery</h3></a>
there's a mean streak in the sky
on the morning when you come by.
and you ask me "would i?"
and i say i would.
and it's an ill wind that blows nobody good.

and i should've known that you'd come my way.
by the dogs spawled out sleeping in the driveway
windows open audibly around the neighborhood,
and it's an ill wind that blows nobody good.

and you touched my hand.
and the sun beats down.
ineffective warnings all over the ground,
and i'm standing on the same spot where you husband stood.
and it's an ill wind that blows nobody good.



<a name="rockin"><h3>rockin' rockin' pet store</h3></a>
one burning afternoon under the waxing jurisdiction of the harvest moon.
we took a right and we went far away and
i remember it as though it were yesterday.
at the pet store.

the stereo played songs we both knew and
i reached my arm around and touched you.
i felt the sun burning into me and
i knew we'd find the physic for my malady
at the pet store.

you hair caught the sunlight as you opened the door
and i'd never seen your hair looking quite that way before.
i heard the parakeets punctuate the moment with their
shrieks and cries.
i saw the reptile cages reflected in your blue eyes.
their green bodies conspiring therein
to form a separate universe where it was no sin 
to want what i wanted right then and there in the pet store.



<a name="seascape"><h3>ambivalent seascape Y</h3></a>
we saw the ship meet the horizon.
we saw it carry him away.
and the streamers on the hull were the last things to wink out of existance
as a cool breeze came in from across the bay.
you dug around in the sand.
you came up holding something.
and when you handed it over with that smile on your face,
i knew the three of us meant less than nothing.
i held the seashell next to my ear, but i didn't hear anything.
i held the seashell next to my ear, but i didn't hear anything.

the dogfish swam beneath the jetty.
where our legs hung down.
and the ocean hugged the sun with her long arms
as the lights came up above chinatown.
i guess this makes it all easier.
i guess it's smooth sailing now.
i guess this irons out all the wrinkles from the fabric.
i guess it never really mattered anyhow.
i held the seashell next to my ear, but i didn't hear anything.

<a name="buffalo"><h3>going to buffalo</h3></a>
lay down just a little while
honey lemon-chamomile
very soon the plane's coming in.

one hour worth of quicksand
the glass warm against your hand
very soon the airplane will take me away.

i will nuzzle up against you and then,
i will never see you again.
fires burning,
the world's turning around.

words that lose their meanings and then swell up like balloons,
very soon the taxi will come.
all the lies you told me can no longer hold me.
very soon the taxi will take me away.

i will forget how you've done me wrong,
how you've strung me along.
fires burning,
learning to breathe.



<a name="repetition"><h3>[untitled] repetition</h3></a>
well the train touched down in souix city, iowa.
the train touched down in souix city, iowa.
it fell cleanly from the dark sky under the track
saw you from the window there was no turning back.

well, the whistle went off. i was leaning up against the window.
yeah the whistle went off. i was leaning up against the window.
i saw the blue passengers walking past me
and you called up the calvary.
it was so easy, and it was so hard,
you were clutching your copy of kirkagaard.
repetition.
repetition.



<a name="brilliant"><h3>brilliant disguise</h3></a>
<h6>this is a bruce springsteen song</h6>
i hold you in my arms as the band plays
what are those words whispered baby, just as you turned away?
i saw you last night out at the edge of town.
i want to read your mind just to know what i've got in this new thing i've found.
so tell me what i see when i look in your eyes.
is that you baby, or just a brilliant disguise?

i heard somebody call your name from underneath our willow.
i saw something tucked in shame underneath your pillow.
well i?ve tried so hard baby, but i just cannot see
what a woman like you could possibly want with a man like me.
so tell me what i see when i look in your eyes.
is it you baby, or just a brilliant disguise?

now you play the loving woman i?ll play the faithful man.
but just don?t look too closely in the palm of my hand.
we stood at the altar the gypsy swore our future was bright.
but come the wee wee hours well maybe baby the gypsy lied.
so when you look at mei, well look hard and look twice.
is that me baby, or just a brilliant disguise?



<a name="themoon"><h3>the moon</h3></a>
i thought that i was in control.
when i saw her coming, i reached out my hand.
you, you, you would think so too
but there is something here that you do not understand.
she's got skin like you would not believe.
i saw her skin and i went out of my mind.
she's got skin more perfect that the sky,
and i reached out my hand and left the world behind.

noone knew what i was talking about,
i used to say that what i saw through my window
was brilliant sap and strong white camelias.
now i see you coming, and i just don't think so.
she's got skin like you would not believe.
i saw her skin and i went out of my mind.
i reached out my hand and i walked out into the rain.
i was right behind the clouds.
i could just see ya coming.

<h6>this is a franklin bruno song</h6>
all i got is a pool key, but it lets me in
to the place where the surface of the water
breaks its contract with the skin.
you can tell me it's still great to come by and chat.
but i'm not completely convinced that you're willing to leave it at that.

and all the clothes in this milkcrate, they're yours for good.
we can take them out to your car and we can lean against the hood.
and you can tell me it's still great to come by and chat.
but i'm not completely convinced that you're willing to leave it at that.

so let's sit down, take off our shoes.
let's just amuse ourselves from noon 'til two.
let's lie down, take off our clothes.
and just suppose there's no starting over to do.
there's no starting over to do.
there's no starting over.

an army of lovers can't be beaten.
have you ever tried to defeat just one?
straighten the pillows while i neaten up the edges of this mattress
where our struggle's just begun.

and let's sit down, take off our shoes.
let's not misuse the time from noon 'til two.
and let's lie down, take off our clothes.
and just suppose there's no starting over to do.

I know you never asked for my opinion,
but I'd say that horse is crazy
I know what I think doesn't matter any more,
but I'd say his mind is gone
and I know you feel the same way,
even though you'd rather die than say it
I know you know what I know,
or you wouldn't be sleeping on the lawn

I heard the hooves crack the window,
saw the body come through
saw the big brown eyes flashing
I fell all over you
I got pressure bearing down
on me

There was a reason why I came here,
but I guess now it doesn't matter
I had a good, good, good, good reason,
but I guess now you couldn't care
There is a certain kind of feeling that you get
when you're totally helpless
and there's a different world waiting for me
when I lift my head up
from your thick, dark hair

I heard the hooves crack the window,
saw the body come through
saw the big nostrils flaring
I fell all over you
I got pressure bearing down
on me

i need water.
i need water.

ants on the window ledge caught my attention.
and i wanted to say so, but i was to tired to mention it.
and we crawled in bed, and melted together.

cursing the weather.
and i need water.

<h6>this is a leonard cohen song</h6>
frankie lane, he was singing jezebel.
i pinned an iron cross to my lapel.
i walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl.
i said, look, you don't know me now but very soon you will.
so won't you let me see,
i said "won't you let me see",
i said "won't you let me see
your naked body?"

just dance me to the dark side of the gym.
chances are i'll let you do most anything.
she said i know you're hungry, i can hear it in your voice.
and there are many parts of me to touch, you have your choice.
but no you cannot see,
she said "no you cannot see",
she said "no you cannot see
my naked body."

so we're dancing close, the band is playing stardust.
balloons and paper streamers floating down on us.
she said, you've got a minute left to fall in love.
in solemn moments such as this i have put my trust.
and all my faith to see,
i said "all my faith to see",
i said "all my faith to see,
her naked body."

how they went under,
took with them everything i own.
that's alright.
it doesn't make me nervous.
'cause i can see the clouds gathering in the distance.
and everytime it rains, it rains pennies from heaven.
and everytime it rains, i'm a rich man.
and everytime it rains, i'm indescribably wealthy.
and everytime it rains, gold coins spill from the heavens straight into my hands.

many have said that the devil was coming.
i looked down at the sidewalk -- three inches of water running.

i looked up at the clouds.
everything looked great.
the financial news network talked about the prime lending rate.
that's alright.
i'm safe and warm.
just over there ya know, near south ontario,
i can see the signals of a tropical storm.
and everytime it rains, it rains pennies from heaven.
and everytime it rains, i'm a rich man.
and everytime it rains, i'm indescribably wealthy.
and everytime it rains, tech stocks spill from the heavens straight into my hands.

many have said that the devil was coming.

<a name="ministry"><h3>how I left the ministry</h3></a>
there was one thing I found that I couldn't help thinking
as they pried me free with the jaws of life
none of this disaster would ever have happened
if I had not been driving my neighbor's wife

to the alta loma day's inn where I'd registered us as
a couple with a name I'm sure some other couple somewhere has

and the last thing I saw before falling unconscious
was your right hand tracing a heart on my thigh
and I thought my god what an infantile gesture
and I thought my god what an indescribable high

the autumn air was sweeter than a slice of wedding cake
as I overshot the exit and I tried and failed to find the brake

<a name="hallelujah"><h3>hallelujah</h3></a>
<h6>Originally by Leonard Cohen</h6>
I finally found the secret chord that david played and it pleased the lord
but you don't really care for music, do ya?
it goes like this:
the fourth, the fifth, the minor fall, the major lift
the hebrew king composing hallelujah

hallelujah!
hallelujah!
hallelujah!
hallelujah!

now your faith was strong, but you needed proof.
you saw her bathing on the roof.
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya.
she tied you to a kitchen chair,
she broke your throat and she cut your hair.
and from your mouth she drew the hallelujah.

hallelujah!
hallelujah!
hallelujah!
hallelujah!

now you say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name, but if I did,
well really, what's it to ya?
there's a blaze of light in every word
it doesn't matter which you heard 
the broken or the holy hallelujah.

hallelujah!
hallelujah!
hallelujah!
hallelujah!

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
tellin' the truth -- I didn't come to fool ya.
and though somehow it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah.

hallelujah!
hallelujah!
hallelujah!
hallelujah!



<h3> <a name="innerjoan">my inner joan crawford vehicle</a> </h3>
cheap drapes frame the windows
no one speaks his mind
buckling asphalt up ahead
smoking wreck behind
stock footage of a ballroom nearly flooded with champagne
we're lost in the desert and it's never going to rain.

every time in this house someone opens up his mouth
all his hopes and dreams begin their dizzy journey south.
when the pipes begin to freeze we turned on all the taps
tearing a good thing to pieces
bickering over the scraps

fried clams from the diner
diesel on the wind
gorge ourselves on caviar when the boat comes in
wait for someone neutral to reckon up the score
grease on the walls of the kitchen
dried blood on the living room floor

you there in your nightgown
head all full of dreams
all the things we'd sewn together splitting at the seams
try to cauterize the wound
just get nowhere fast
holding each other for dear life
shielding ourselves from the blast.


<h3> <a name="surrounded">surrounded</a> </h3>
cold white moon shines down on colorado
hide my dirty secrets
down here in the shadows
where the quaking aspens
tremble in the snow
hold me up above the rafters
raise me high and let me go
let me fall down through my own roof like a meteorite
let the world and all its wonders leave me to my toys tonight
and my ninty-six inch television screen
let me die.
let me die surrounded by machines.

high winds knocked the power out last night
but i've got my own supply here
all my windows fill with light
and the light floods through the windows to the open plain below
finds nothing but some trees and six fresh feet of snow
and I find a broadcast station that's signed off for the night
and the static floods the speakers in glorious black and white
on my ninty-six inch television screen
let me die.
let me die surrounded by machines.

long ago and far away 

and someone leads the beast in on its chain 
but I know you're thinking of me cause it's just about to rain 

so I won't be afraid 
of anything ever again 

in the cell that holds my body back 
the door swings wide 
and I feel like someone's lost child 
as the guard leads me outside 

and if the clouds are gathering 
it's just to point the way 
to an afternoon I spent with you 
when it rained all day 

and someone leads the beast in on its chain 
but I know you're thinking of me cause it's just about to rain 

so I won't be afraid 
of anything ever again

these roses are the pleasures of the flesh
these ones here they are the pleasures of the spirit
and tucked behind a pornographic picture in a frame
the troops found the pierced heart and they all gathered near it

and the dust clouds bloomed in the dark
and the face gazed up from the frame
roomful of French troops in a Franciscan abbey
history does not recall their names

of the several things that you have to do today
you're gonna regret one
this generation asks for a sign
it isn't gonna get one

bertha took the pictures to the priest
and the priest fell on his face upon the floor
and the story lived on for a decade or two
but no one really knows it anymore

but the blessed heart is seen in the airbrush
and the blessed heart is beating on the wind
and the bodies of the faithful stacked by dozens by the roadsides
stripped and scourged and skinned

of the several things that you have to do today
you're gonna regret one
this generation asks for a sign
it isn't gonna get one

I looked for trouble and I found it son
straight down the barrel of a lawman's gun
I tried to run but I don't think I can
he said make one move and you're dead man
I ain't living long like this
I can't live at all like this, can I now

you know the story about the wheel go round
don't let them take you son
at all downtown

came out of houston off of Wayside drive
son of a carhop in some all night dive
dad drove a stock car to an early death
all I remember was a drunk man's breath
I ain't living long like this
I can't live at all like this

you know the story about the wheel go round
don't let 'em take son at all downtown

I live for angel, she's a roadhouse queen
makes texas ruby look like sandra dee
I want to love her but I don't know how
I'm at the bottom of the jailhouse now
I ain't living long like this
I can't live at all like this

you heard the story about the jailhouse rock
go out and do it, don't get caught
I ain't living long like this



<h3> <a name="hereiam">here I am</a> </h3>
<h6>mary chapin carpenter cover</h6>
I've waited longer for lesser things
but here I am
who really knows what tomorrow brings
but here I am
just in case you were wondering
just in case you got lost again
just in case you run out of friends, here I am

it's so easy to rip and to tear, so here I am
what you need most
vanishes into thin air, so here I am
maps and compasses may stay true
it doesn't really matter what you do
I have never forgotten you
here I am

some days our reach
seems to exceed our grasp
I gave up hoping long ago
I could fix the past

today I called you
for the very first time in a million years
you would never believe me if I told of
these million tears
life doesn't wave as it's speeding by
grab on fast and hold on tight
and don't ever forget to fight this good fight
here I am



<h3> <a name="quiencomotu">qui&eacute;n como t&uacute;</a> </h3>
<h6>ana gabriel cover</h6>
El perfume de su almohada, tu lo conoces bien 
y la humedad de sus sabanas blancas tambi&eacute;n 
que suerte la tuya que puedes tenerlo a tus pies 
sintiendo en tu boca sus besos que saben a miel 

Mirando como le hablas de amor el tiempo no se detiene 
y nada tengo yo que esperar aunque me quede en el aire 

Qui&eacute;n como t&uacute;, que d&iacute;a a d&iacute;a puedes tenerle 
qui&eacute;n como t&uacute;, que solo entre tus brazos se duerme 
qui&eacute;n como t&uacute; 
que con ternura cura sus fiebres 
qui&eacute;n como t&uacute; 

Esas noches de locura, tu las disfrutas bien 
y entre sus brazos las horas no pasan lo se 

Mirando como le hablas de amor el tiempo no se detiene 
y nada tengo yo que esperar aunque me quede en el aire 

Qui&eacute;n como t&uacute;, que d&iacute;a a d&iacute;a puedes tenerle 
qui&eacute;n como t&uacute;, que solo entre tus brazos se duerme 
qui&eacute;n como t&uacute; 
que con ternura cura sus fiebres 
qui&eacute;n como t&uacute;
